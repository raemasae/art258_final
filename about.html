        <h2>MUGS WITH MEANING</h2>
        <p>Hello! I'm Eunice, just another fellow day dreamer ...dreaming away :)
    My friends and random life events inspire me to create. I love making customized gifts for friends, incoporating the special things about them into whatever I am creating.
        </p>
        <p>
        All of our mugs are exclusive, original designs by Sincerely Eunice. We can also customize any mug  by adding a personalized message!
        </p>
        <p>In our studio, we utilize a combination of hand drawn art with digital conversion and design. The design is then hand pressed onto our ceramic mugs at extreme heat utilizing a sublimation process. This process ensures a high quality with a low tolerance for any defects. The mugs are hand packed and individually wrapped before being dropped off at the post office.</p>
